BATTLE ANALYSIS - ACTUAL GAMEPLAY STATS
====================================================================

FINAL STATS USED:
- HP: 50/50
- ATK: 610
- END: 615
- EP: 83.0/83.0
- EP Regen: 13.0
- Skills: 8

WHY THIS BUILD SUCCEEDED:

1. MAXIMUM ENDURANCE (615)
   - Reduced all of Arlong's damage to 1 per hit
   - Formula: (520 - 615) / 2 = -47.5 → minimum 1
   - Effectively invincible with 50 HP = 50 hits survivable
   - Even Phase 3 Arlong (600 ATK) deals only: (600-615)/2 = -7.5 → 1 damage

2. VERY HIGH ATTACK (610)
   - G2 amplified: 610 × 2.2 = 1342
   - Front Lotus: 1342 × 0.95 = 1274.9 → 428 per hit × 2 = 856 damage
   - Reverse Lotus: 1342 × 1.25 = 1677.5 → 644 per hit × 5 = 3220 damage
   - Total damage in 2 skills: 4076 (exceeds Arlong's 2500 HP)

3. SUFFICIENT EP POOL (83.0)
   - G2 activation: -45 EP → 38 EP remaining
   - +13 regen - 9 upkeep = +4 net per turn
   - Turn 2: 38 + 4 = 42 EP (enough for Front Lotus -13)
   - Turn 3: 29 + 4 = 33 EP (enough for Reverse Lotus -25)

4. STAGGER MECHANICS
   - Front Lotus: Created safe Turn 2
   - Reverse Lotus: Battle ended immediately
   - Never needed the second stagger

COMBAT SEQUENCE:
- Turn 1: G2 activation, took 1 damage (49/50 HP)
- Turn 2: Front Lotus → 856 damage, stagger applied
- Turn 3: Reverse Lotus → 3220 damage → INSTANT VICTORY

DAMAGE SUMMARY:
- Total damage dealt: 4076 (overkill by 1576)
- Arlong HP: 2500
- Damage taken: 1
- Final HP: 49/50 (98%)

EP USAGE:
- Started: 83.0
- Turn 1: -45 (G2) = 38.0
- Turn 2: +13 -9 -13 (FL) = 29.0
- Turn 3: +13 -9 -25 (RL) = 8.0
- Remaining: 8.0 EP

EFFICIENCY RATING: ★★★★★
- 3-turn victory (optimal speed)
- 98% HP preserved
- Perfect skill execution
- Zero wasted actions

====================================================================

KEY INSIGHTS:

1. 610 ATK is sufficient for 3-turn victory
2. 615 END makes player nearly immortal vs Arlong
3. 83 EP pool is exactly enough for G2 + combo
4. 50 HP is viable when taking only 1 damage/hit
5. 8 skills sufficient

MINIMUM BUILD REQUIREMENTS:
- ATK ≥ 550 (to deal ~3500 total damage with combo)
- END ≥ 520 (to reduce damage to 1 per hit)
- EP ≥ 83 (exact amount for G2 + Front + Reverse)
- Skills: G1, G2, Gate Mastery, Front Lotus, Reverse Lotus

This build demonstrates PERFECT stat allocation:
- 20 ATK sessions
- 16 END sessions  
- 4 EP sessions
- 8 Self-Discovery sessions
- 0 HP sessions (unnecessary with high END)
