VICTORY

====================================================================
BATTLE ANALYSIS - GLASS CANNON TANK VICTORY
====================================================================

WHY THIS BUILD SUCCEEDED:

1. MAXIMUM ENDURANCE (615) - The Key Factor
   - Reduced Arlong's 520 ATK to minimum damage (1 per hit)
   - Formula: (520 - 615) / 2 = negative, capped at 1
   - Effectively "immortal" against base Arlong attacks
   - Even Phase 3 (600 ATK) would deal only 1 damage

2. MAXIMUM ATTACK (469) with G2 Multiplier
   - G2 amplified ATK: 469 × 2.2 = 1031.8
   - Reverse Lotus: 1031.8 × 1.25 = 1289.75 per hit
   - 5 hits (G2 bonus) = 2250 damage in one turn
   - Enough to finish Arlong from >1900 HP

3. STAGGER MECHANICS
   - Front Lotus created first stagger window
   - Prevented Arlong from attacking Turn 2
   - Reverse Lotus created second stagger window
   - Battle ended before stagger expired

4. EP SUSTAINABILITY
   - Started with 173 EP (sufficient for full combo)
   - G2 activation: -45 EP
   - Front Lotus: -13 EP
   - Reverse Lotus: -25 EP
   - Total spent: 83 EP (well within budget)
   - EP regen + initial pool = no resource issues

DAMAGE BREAKDOWN:
- Turn 1: 0 damage (activated G2)
- Turn 2: 562 damage via Front Lotus
- Turn 3: 2250 damage via Reverse Lotus
- TOTAL: 2812 damage (exceeded Arlong's 2500 HP)

DAMAGE TAKEN:
- Turn 1: 1 damage (minimum)
- Turn 2: 0 damage (staggered)
- Turn 3: Battle ended
- TOTAL: 1 damage taken

EFFICIENCY RATING: ★★★★★
- 3-turn victory (optimal)
- 98% HP remaining (near perfect)
- No wasted actions
- Perfect skill sequencing

====================================================================

ALTERNATIVE VICTORY PATH (If Arlong survived Turn 3):

Turn 4: Arlong staggered, cannot attack
- Use Chain Barrage or Kei-ga-n Barrage
- Estimated 300-400 additional damage

Turn 5: Arlong attacks for 1 damage
- Keigan HP: 48/50
- Use Chain Barrage (off cooldown)

Turn 6+: Continue DPS with multi-hit skills
- Victory guaranteed by Turn 6-7

====================================================================

KEY LESSONS FROM THIS BUILD:

1. ✓ HP is NOT mandatory if END is maximized
2. ✓ High END makes enemy attacks negligible
3. ✓ High ATK with Gates = massive burst damage
4. ✓ Stagger effects are crucial for safety
5. ✓ Reverse Lotus is the ultimate finisher

BUILD REQUIREMENTS FOR REPLICATION:
- ATK ≥ 400 (to reach 880+ with G2 for high damage)
- END ≥ 550 (to reduce Arlong's damage to 1-5 range)
- EP ≥ 150 (to afford G2 + Front Lotus + Reverse Lotus)
- All 8 Skills unlocked (especially Reverse Lotus)

RISK LEVEL: MEDIUM
Despite 50 HP, high END makes build surprisingly safe.
Only catastrophic errors (deactivating Gate early) cause failure.

====================================================================

CONCLUSION:

This "Glass Cannon Tank" build proves that ENDURANCE is the most
important defensive stat, not HP. By negating enemy damage through
high END and ending battles quickly with high ATK, Keigan can achieve
perfect victories even with base HP.

The key insight: Dead enemies deal no damage.
